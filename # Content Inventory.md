## **- About Me Page -**

Hello there! I'm Vy Nguyen, a designer, driven to create magical user experiences. I am passionate about integrating accessibility and inclusiveness into my products. I am currently a junior at Drexel University, studying Human-Centered Design and Engineering. Aside from my work, I love to hike, jam on my Epiphone Les Paul guitar, and explore new destinations with my eccentric cat, BMO (named after Adventure Time). I am originally from Florida but currently based in Philadelphia.

## **- My Work Page -**

For my portfolio work section, I hope to display my featured and most recent UX/UI projects from academics and co-op (with granted permission of course). Within each of the work projects, I will showcase a comprehensive overview of what occurred during the project from objectives to tools used to the user research performed. Within each of the project, I will also have included samples of my work and links to my prototypes off of InVision. (Down the line if there is time I really hope to figure out how to showcase my microinteractions/animations without having to do an embeded video version of it on the site.)

1. **Guru (Google Design Challenge/Completed UX/UI Case Study)**
* Aim: A platform where mentors and mentees can discover each other and begin their journey in building a trusting relationship for personal and professional growth.
* Problem Statement
* Sketches and low-fidelity wireframes
* Samples of the mentee profiles vs. mentor profiles
* Results/What I truly learned throughout this process

2. **Drexel University Mobile App Redesign (Side Project)**
* Aim: Redesigning the official mobile app of Drexel University, known as DrexelOne Mobile
* Project scope/My role
* User research and examples of this
* Low and Mid-fidelity of existing interface
* Sketches
* Prototypes embeded onto the site for users to see and interact with
 
3. **Bloom Workspace (Self-creation/Academic Project)** 
* Sketches
* Low to Mid to Hi-Fidelity showcase
* Final product via InVision link
* This case study definitely needs work but it will be finished by the end of Week 10 in preparation for the final project of this class

4. **Craigslist Redesign (Academic Project)**
* Aim: Objective/Goals
* Problem space
* Design process
* User research/background information on the problem
* Actions/Solutions
* Samples
  * Sketches
  * Final prototype
* Conclusion - What did I discover and what did I learn?

Most of these case studies are already completed and saved on my drive but wasn't sure if I should paste them onto my content inventory since they're VERY LONG but my point in displaying this layout on here is to show that each of these numbered items are going to be showcased under my work section with lots of content including sample photos, sketches, written paragraphs of explanation behind my design and process, etc.

## **- Side Work -**

I want to include my work from Dribbble and work that I have saved on my computer that I have never published before. I have projects that I have made outside of school and my professional work that I would love to showcase.
