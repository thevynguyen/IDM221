# Review of the Websites

### **- Yi Nie -**

_Home Page_

* The landing page has an automated background micro animation that makes it more engaging and enticing to users like me since I expected to come onto the landing page to explore the designer's portfolio but right off the bat it gives me stronger insight as to the personality of this designer. 
* Minimalistic and subtly simple but still intriguing to the eyes - I truly enjoy portfolio pages that get right to the point where they list their name and purpose/mission so the users can already see what to expect out of their work.
* Again, there are a ton of microinteractions on this page which makes it feel more personable and comforting - gives me a better read on the type of person I am reviewing.
* I feel like the small featured of works section on the landing page is very concise and efficient to showcase but I feel like there should be additional items such as a personable photos or quotes to make the site feel more of a "you" energy.

_Side Work_

* The showcasing of prominent side projects and works are distinguishable than other portfolio sites I've seen since most of the time people just link their Dribbble or Behance pages rather than just showcasing them directly on their main website which I really like and it makes it easier to view.
* I find the two column layout to be fitting as it doesn't seem to clutter the entire page and leaves a lot of white space which I think is important for portfolios and gives more of an easier feel to the eyes.

Overall, this site has inspired me in terms of the types of microinteractions and animations it portrays throughout the pages which makes the site more engaging and creative. I want my site to express my personality as a person and as a designer.

_Home Page_

* I really like the landing page layout of this website because each scroll down is a different color palette and layout which makes each content feel it's own level of significance and relevance while showcasing their works.
* The selected fonts are really easy to read and feel which gives me a lot of inspiration to branch out with my typography. 

_About Page_ 

* The About Page is a bit long for my taste in the sense that it has a lot of information and scrolling down takes a while instead of just seeing everything at once when frst arriving onto the page so I would enjoy a more minimalistic look for my About Page. 

_Mixtapes Page_

* I really love this page the most on this entire site because of how creative and different it is compared to most. I am so intrigued and find it more personable that they gave a list of their preferred music/mixtapes while incorporating design into it. 
    * I truly enjoy the layout of it and where the buttons are located with such ease for a page that has such large content. I always am afraid to use content that is too large for the eyes since I get nervous about people spending more time scrolling but this section on the website gives me more ease knowing that there are simple ways to do what I want with large content and organizing the layout hierarchy in a way.

Overall, I find the layout of this site to be intriguing and exciting since each scroll is a different color palette and vision.

_Home Page_

* The color palette choices are excellent and subtle so not too hard to read and see. 
* The layout of featured works is organized and front-center where I don't have to look hard to find it. 
* There is a microinteraction as soon as you land on the page which makes it seem friendly and personable.

_Menu Bar_

* This particular aspect of the website is something I find to be interesting since the menu icon is on the right but when you click it the menu displays in the middle of the page.

_About Page_

* This page takes a bunch of minimalistic approaches, however, I feel like the colors are a bit light and makes it harder to read/skim through so perhaps using bold or italicizing the text will make certain aspects of it stand out more for users going through the author bio.
  * I do like the layout of the page where each section is divided even further and resembles a resume style layout.

Overall, this site provides me with a great amount of inspo for minimalism and various approaches to make my site light especially since I know I have a lot of content therefore I don't want to overwhelm my possible audience that look at my page.
