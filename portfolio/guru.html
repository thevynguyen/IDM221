                <u>Problem Statement:</u>
                Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may become a mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.

                <u>Context:</u>
                I used some of my personal experiences working as a student ambassador at Drexel University, where I speak to prospective students and families. From personal experience, I currently work as a student ambassador for Drexel University where I speak to prospective students and their families. One of the concerns I address the most often is about the transition from high school to college and whether or not the adjustment to college life is difficult. It is usually the job of the universities to assist with resources and support during the incoming students first year on campus since it is an entirely new environment to them away from home and their parents. To note: Drexel University is a co-op school therefore every student is on a varying track and co-op is an integral part of Drexel so I included it within my design.
